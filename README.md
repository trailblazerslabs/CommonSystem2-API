# Introduction 
This API has one endpoint, api/AuthTest/Test. This endpoint requires authentication, in a way easily replicable to other endpoints. The endpoint should return a string listing the authenticated user's permissions.

# Getting Started
The project should run without any special requirements. The packages can be installed via NuGet. Please contact us via Teams if there are any issues.

Configuration constants should not be hardcoded, instead appsettings.json should be used for all configuration. 

# Build and Test
There are currently no automated tests on this project
